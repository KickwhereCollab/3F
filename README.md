# 3F
## A short collection of coding problems and my solutions.

1. Write a function to reverse a singly linked list. What are some different approaches and the advantages/disadvantages of each?

2. Implement a stack of integers with <i>push(), pop()</i> and <i> getMax()</i> where <i>getMax()</i> returns the maximum integer value in the stack. This should be O(1)time/constant time. Do not extend the stack. List all assumptions and limitations when you design it.

3. Create the object-oriented architecture of an animal universe. Expose a REST API to allow different actions to be executed through REST. For example, I'd want to be able to execute a REST API to make a dog bark and then I'd receive a message back saying it barked successfully. Implement at least 6 animals with inheritance, composition including animals, their types, and basic actions.

4. Print out an array of Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number in the sequence

5. Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
